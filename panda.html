                    <h10>PANDA</h10>
                    <P> A panda’s diet consists mostly of bamboo shoots. In fact, that’s about 99% of what they eat. They also tend to eat other grasses as well as small rodents. The pandas that live in the zoos are generally fed a diet of bamboo, carrots, apples, sugar cane, high fiber biscuits and sweet potatoes.
                     Giant Pandas do not hibernate during the winter months. Because they have such lean diets, they do not gain the added fat that is needed in order to hibernate.
                    The giant panda is currently on the endangered species list of the World Conservation Union. It is believed that there are about 1600 pandas currently living in the wild and only about 300 living in breeding centers and zoos across the world. here is a legend about how pandas got their black and white fur. 
                    The legend states that pandas used to be all white. One day, however, a young girl tried to save a small panda from an attacking leopard, and the leopard ended up killing the girl. The story says that the all-white pandas came to her funeral wearing armbands made of black ashes. As the pandas hugged and comforted each other, 
                    the black ash smeared and created black-and-white pandas.Pandas are probably the most easily recognized bear in the world. Their fur is starkly contrasting patches of black and white, with black ears and black eye patches. Their legs, shoulders, and tail are also black, and the rest of their body is white.</P>
                    <P>Giant pandas grow to between 1.2m and 1.5m, and weigh between 75kg and 135kg. Scientists aren’t sure how long pandas live in the wild, but in captivity they live to be around 30 years old. 6. Baby pandas are born pink and measure about 15cm – that’s about the size of a penciL. The habitat of the giant panda is mainly forests which have rich bamboo growth.
                     The panda loves to live near places which have a clear running brook and is laden with bamboo. Pandas do not build homes or dens, except for their cubs. A terrestrial being, the panda marks its territory by clawing trees, with scent and also by spraying urine to differentiate its habitat from others.And the warm rains on the southern slopes support a rich variety of plants and animals. 
                     Along with a few hundred pandas, the mountains are also home to other endangered species, including the golden monkey, takin and crested ibis.</P>  
                    <P>Although the panda belongs to the orderof the predator e(Carnivora),he eats only in exception birds, insects or other meat. His diet consists mainly of tubers, acorns, birch bark, bamboo sprouts and berries. For handling its food, the panda's hands contain a unique sixth finger, an elongated hand root bone that fulfills roughly the same function as man's thumb.These magnificent mammals are omnivores. 
                    But whilst pandas will occasionally eat small animals and fish, bamboo counts for 99 percent of their diet</P>
