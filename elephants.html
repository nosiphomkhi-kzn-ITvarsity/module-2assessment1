                    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                    <P>
                    Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; extinct members include the mastodons. The family Elephantidae also contains several extinct groups,
                     including the mammoths and straight-tusked elephants. African elephantshave larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs.. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs. Distinctive features of all elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin. The trunk is used for breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects. 
                     Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. The pillar-like legs carry their great weight.
                     </P>Elephant ears have thick bases with thin tips. The ear flaps, or pinnae, contain numerous blood vessels called capillaries. Warm blood flows into the capillaries, helping to release excess body heat into the environment. This occurs when the pinnae are still, and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released.
                     Of all the elephants.<p> African bush elephants live in the hottest climates, and have the largest ear flaps.[40] Elephants are capable of hearing at low frequencies and are most sensitive at 1 kHz (in close proximity to the Soprano C).
                     Male Asian elephants are usually about 261–289 cm (8 ft 7 in–9 ft 6 in) tall at the shoulder and 3.5–4.6 t (3.9–5.1 short tons) whereas females are 228–252 cm (7 ft 6 in–8 ft 3 in) tall at the shoulder and 2.3–3.1 t (2.5–3.4 short tons).
                     Elephants are about 7,000 kg(15,000 lb),those elephants with larger ears flaps and control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight, Africans elephants have larger ear than the Asia elephants have smaller ears.

                     <P>Elephats are well known as herbivores and can be found in different habits including forest,desert, and also in marshes. They prefer to stay near water </P>
                     <p><STRONG>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</STRONG></p>
                     <P>You will find them next to pen E22, right next to the emphiitheatre.</P>
