                    <h11>WARTHOG</h11>
                    <P>They are pigs who live in open and semi-open habitats, even in quite arid regions, in sub-Saharan Africa. The two species were formerly considered conspecific under the scientific name Phacochoerus aethiopicus, but today this is limited to the desert warthog, while the best-known and most widespread species, the common warthog.
                    Although covered in bristly hairs, their bodies and heads appear largely naked from a distance, with only the crest along the back, and the tufts on their cheeks and tails being obviously haired. The English name refers to their facial wattles, which are particularly distinct in males. They also have very distinct tusks, which reach a length of 10 to 25 inches (25 to 64 centimetres) in the males,
                     but are always smaller in the femalesWarthog use their tusks for digging, fighting with rivals and defending themselves against predators. They have long been used as an alternative to ivory in ornamental carving. Both male warthogs (boars) and females (sows) have ivory tusks on their upper and lower jaws, which are extremely sharp. Their tusks are used for digging up solid soil, 
                     defending themselves against predators and fighting against rivals. Warthogs are threatened by poachers who hunt them for their ivory tusks and meat. Warthog tusks have long been used in ornamental carving. Warthogs love to communicate with each other and use a variety of different sounds from grunts to squeals and snorts. After reaching adulthood, boars will leave the sounder and lead a solitary life.

                     <P>he odd behaviour that warthogs show when backing into burrows arises as a result of being able to attack tusk-first. It’s a security system which allows the last hog in to act as a guard on patrol.
                     Warthogs do get on well with some other creatures, despite being territorial. For example, they have a partnership with mongooses – as a mongoose will happily groom a warthog in return for some tasty ticks.While warthogs are known to forage at night if things get dangerous, they generally follow the same sleep patterns as us. They are active in the day, and sleep when it gets dark. 
                     This is likely due to what they deem to be the safest of cycles.Warthogs have specially-adapted protective pads on their wrists that allow them to ‘kneel’ down to feed. Thanks to their short necks and relativity long legs it is far easier for them to kneel while grazing than it would be for other grazers. Warthogs are one of the most interesting mammals to behold. Not necessarily because they are beautiful; not at all. 
                     The contrary is actually the case. These pigs can be found in many places in the dark continent. They are the main pigs that can readily live in regions without water for a long time. By enduring a higher-than-typical body temperature, the warthog can retain its body water content longer than normal, and use this water for cooling. This water conservation mechanism is similar to the one present in camels.</P>  
                    <P> An omnivore, it uses its rubbery snout to grub up roots and tubers, they also Warthogs mainly eat dry grass and will use their snout to dig for roots and bulbs</P>
                     <p><STRONG>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</STRONG></p>
                     <P>The common warthog is found in much of Africa, below the Sahara desert. They are abundant in East Africa and Southern Africa, with their favourite habitat being grassland, savannah and woodlands. Warthogs do enjoy their water and mud. </P>
