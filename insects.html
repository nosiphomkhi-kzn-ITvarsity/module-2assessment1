                    <h3>INSECTS</h3>
                     <P>Insects are everywhere. We encounter them every day. Insects do not breathe through their mouths. They inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide via holes called spiracles in their exoskeletons. These holes typically line insects' thoraxes and abdomens. Also bizarre:
                     Insect respiratory systems are not patched into the animals' circulatory systems, as they are in humans, where the lungs exchange gases with the bloodstream. Instead, insects have a cardiovascular-like network of tubes, called a tracheal system.
                     insects have an open circulatory system, in which their blood, called "hemolymph," bathes the organs. The insect "heart" is a segmented and chambered vessel running along the animal's back. This vessel contracts to send hemolymph forward toward the head; 
                     from there, it sloshes around back into the rest of the body. </P>
                     <P><STRONG>where can you find it</STRONG></P> 
                     <p>insects can be found by the buckets just about anywhere on Earth, there's one continent where they barely have a foothold: Antarctica.They live in almost every habitat on the planet except for the poles and the sea.
                     They often feed on fungi and plants but can also be found eating other invertebrates, animals, and plant debris. </P>
