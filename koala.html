                    <H7>KOALA</h7>
                    <P>Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloricThe Queensland koala is the smallest of the three, with shorter, silver fur and a shorter skull. The Victorian koala is the largest, with shaggier, brown fur and a wider skull.[22][23] The boundaries of these variations are based on state borders, and their status as subspecies is disputed.
                     A 1999 genetic study suggests that the variations represent differentiated populations with limited gene flow between them, and that the three subspecies comprise a single evolutionarily significant unit.[23] Other studies have found that koala populations have high levels of inbreeding and low genetic variation content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day.
                     They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates.The koala is a stocky animal with a large head and vestigial or non-existent tail.
                     It has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and a weight of 4–15 kg (9–33 lb),[30] making it among the largest arboreal marsupials.[31] Koalas from Victoria are twice as heavy as those from Queensland.koala is thicker and longer on the back, and shorter on the belly. The ears have thick fur on both the inside and outside.[31] The back fur colour varies from light grey to chocolate brown
                     The belly fur is whitish; on the rump it is dappled whitish, and darker at the back.[30] The koala has the most effective insulating back fur of any marsupial and is highly resilient to wind and rain, while the belly fur can reflect solar radiation.[36] The koala's curved, sharp claws are well adapted for climbing trees. The large forepaws have two opposable digits (the first and second, which are opposable to the other three) that allow them to grasp small branches.
                     The koala has several adaptations for its eucalypt diet, which is of low nutritive value, of high toxicity, and high in dietary fibre. The animal's dentition consists of the incisors and cheek teeth (a single premolar and four molars on each jaw), which are separated by a large gap (a characteristic feature of herbivorous mammals). The incisors are used for grasping leaves, which are then passed to the premolars to be snipped at the petiole before being passed to the highly cusped molars. </P>
                     <P>they get so little energy from their diet, koalas must limit their energy use and sleep or rest 20 hours a day.[63][64] They are predominantly active at night and spend most of their waking hours feeding. They typically eat and sleep in the same tree, possibly for as long as a day.[65] On very hot days, a koala may climb down to the coolest part of the tree which is cooler than the surrounding air. The koala hugs the tree to lose heat without panting. 
                     On warm days, a koala may rest with its back against a branch or lie on its stomach or back with its limbs dangling. During cold, wet periods, it curls itself into a tight ball to conserve energy. On windy days, a koala finds a lower, thicker branch on which to rest. While it spends most of the time in the tree, the animal descends to the ground to move to another tree, walking on all fours. The koala usually grooms itself with its hindpaws, but sometimes uses its forepaws or mouth.Koalas may live from 13 to 18 years in the wild. 
                     While female koalas usually live this long, males may die sooner because of their more hazardous lives. Koalas usually survive falls from trees and immediately climb back up, but injuries and deaths from falls do occur, particularly in inexperienced young and fighting males. Around six years of age, the koala's chewing teeth begin to wear down and their chewing efficiency decreases. Eventually, the cusps disappear completely and the animal will die of starvation.The broad face has a wide, rounded, leathery nose, small yellow eyes, and big fluffy ears.
                     The feet are strong and clawed; the two inner digits of the front feet and the innermost digit of the hind feet are opposable for grasping. Because of the animal’s superficial resemblance to a small bear, the koala is sometimes called, albeit erroneously, the koala bear.</P>
                     <P>The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear, is a herbivorous,Koala teeth are especially adapted for their gumleaf diet. Their sharp front teeth nip the leaves from the tree and their back teeth are shaped for cutting and grinding the leaves to extract the most nourishment.</P>

                     <P>Koalas are found in the eucalyptus forests of eastern Australia,</P>
