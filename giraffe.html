                    <h5>GIRAFFE</h5>
                     <p>The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east.
                     Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species.
                     This giraffe has large dark patches that usually have complete margins, but may also have sharp edges. The dark spots may also have paler radiating lines or streaks within them.
                     A giraffe rests by lying with its body on top of its folded legs.[40]:329 To lie down, the animal kneels on its front legs and then lowers the rest of its body. To get back up, it first gets on its knees and spreads its hind legs to raise its hindquarters. It then straightens its front legs. With each step, the animal swings its head. </p>
                     <P>They comprise 52–54 per cent of the length of the giraffe's vertebral column, compared with the 27–33 percent typical of similar large ungulates, including the giraffe's closest living relative, the okapi.[18] This elongation largely takes place after birth, perhaps because giraffe mothers would have a difficult time giving birth to young with the same neck proportions as adults.[67] The giraffe's head and neck are held up by large muscles and a strengthened nuchal ligament.
                     The circulatory system of the giraffe has several adaptations for its great height. Its heart, which can weigh more than 11 kg (25 lb) and measures about 60 cm (2 ft) long, must generate approximately double the blood pressure required for a human to maintain blood flow to the brain. As such, the wall of the heart can be as thick as 7.5 cm (3.0 in).[50] Giraffes have unusually high heart rates for their size, at 150 beats per minutes.
                     They also feed on shrubs, grass and fruit.[40]:324 A giraffe eats around 34 kg (75 lb) of foliage daily.[45] When stressed, giraffes may chew the bark off branches.
                     </P>Giraffes have high adult survival probability,[104][105] and an unusually long lifespan compared to other ruminants, up to 38 years.[106] Because of their size, eyesight and powerful kicks, adult giraffes are usually not subject to predation,[45] although lions may regularly prey on individuals up to 550 kg (1,210 lb).[107] Giraffes<p><STRONG>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</STRONG></p>

                     <P>Giraffes live in an ecosystem called the savannaTemperatures during the dry season range from about 68 degrees to 78 degrees and during the wet season, temperatures increase to between 78 degrees and 88 degrees.
                     Savannas are mostly found in deserts and the tropical rain forests, which are wet enough to grow a smattering of trees together with the shrubs, but extremely dry for woodlands.
                     All giraffes are herbivores, They prefer to feed on tender leaves and some buds but will also eat flowers and other fruits in season.</P>
